    <string name="vcpage">Dear friends,

It is a feeling of joy to be with you. Maulana Azad National Urdu University, equipped with the mandate to quench the thirst of knowledge seekers through Urdu Medium, is a unique institution in real sense. MANUU has undergone massive changes in the recent years.

Now the University campus is dotted with new well designed buildings that are host to a large number of newly created departments, Centres and Civil Services Examination Coaching Academy. There are also new hostel buildings for the boys and girls besides a well equipped indoor stadium.

The way forward from here is to focus on reaching out to the unreached; to consolidate what has been built; to create good infrastructure at our off campuses; to improve the quality of education; to increase the knowledge base in Urdu and; to create conducive environment for quality research.
MANUU is a unique university which imparts education to its students through Urdu medium.  This characteristic of MANUU presents us with monumental challenges.

When MANUU began functioning in 1998 its primary route to offer education was through distance education mode. It remained so for the next few years and the number of students registered with the University swelled to about one lakh at one point of time. But somehow the attention to distance education mode got diluted.
MANUU has taken a decision recently to work on distance education mode seriously and clear all the hurdles in its way.

Right now there are thousands of students enlisted with the distance education mode, more than half of them being female. It has been decided to plug the lacuna in the system and tighten the monitoring mechanism at all the 160 Study Centres; nine Regional and five Sub-Regional Centres with the help of latest technology.  It has also been decided to open online admission system. The difficulties faced by students in counseling, writing examination and obtaining degrees, diplomas and certificates will be removed. All these and other measures are expected to increase the number of students in this system of education many-fold.

The other determination at MANUU is to reinforce self-confidence amongst students. They would be provided with facilities to become proficient in English with a view to enhancing their chances of employability. When they leave the campus, they should not feel inferior in any manner to job competitor from any other university or institution.

Another important dimension on which MANUU has begun to work is to increase the availability of knowledge material by producing and translating subject literature in Urdu.
